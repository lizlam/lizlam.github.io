   <title>Create a Macro to Lint a Jenkinsfile</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2017/09/07/create-a-jenkinsfile-linter-macro/"/>
   <updated>2017-09-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2017/09/07/create-a-jenkinsfile-linter-macro</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/09/06/today-i-learned-how-to-lint-jenkinsfile/&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I Learned&lt;/em&gt; how to lint a Jenkinsfile.  In the process of writing up that blog, I was curious about how it would work as a vi macro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a quick refresher, here is how you record a macro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;qa&lt;/code&gt; - start recording a macro  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; - stop recording  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@a&lt;/code&gt; - play back the macro you just recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in vi, you can run shell commands using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; while in escape mode.  Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:  Open Your Jenkinsfile in vi&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vi Jenkinsfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:  Start Recording a Macro:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;qa&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:  Enter the Steps to Run the Jenkinsfile Linter&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;! java -jar /path/to/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://JENKINS_URL declarative-linter &amp;lt; %&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:  Stop Recording&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now whenever I’m working on a Jenkinsfile, I can hit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@a&lt;/code&gt; to lint my current file.  So cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: When you replay the macro, it may go too fast for you to see the results of the linting.  Since it was executed in the current shell, you will see the results to STDOUT when you exit vi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Today I Learned How to Lint a Jenkinsfile</title>

   <updated>2017-09-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2017/09/06/today-i-learned-how-to-lint-jenkinsfile</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today I Learned&lt;/em&gt; how to lint a Jenkinsfile.  Linting is the process of running some program that will verify your code for syntax errors.  I’ve been finding myself writing a lot of Jenkinsfiles lately and it’s a bit of a pain to write directly into the Jenkins UI where the linting happens.  There doesn’t seem to be any external plugins for IDE’s and editors, so in the meantime I was able to use Jenkins CLI to accomplish this in two steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Download the Jenkins CLI&lt;/strong&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;
Open a browser and navigate to:  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http//JENKINS_URL/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Execute the Linter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://JENKINS_URL declarative-linter &amp;lt; /path/to/Jenkinsfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it!  It’s a simple but manual process.  This could probably be easily scripted in an external tool in Eclipse or some other IDE.  I tend to write my Jenkinsfiles in vi so it would be an interesting to see if I can simply record a macro to lint my current file.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Today I Learned About the POSIX Locale and Docker</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2017/06/21/today-i-learned-about-locale-docker/"/>
   <updated>2017-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2017/06/21/today-i-learned-about-locale-docker</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today I learned&lt;/em&gt; that the default locale for an Ubuntu image in a Docker container is not what I expected it to be.  I was trying to view some Greek file names in a container and they did not
appear correctly.  I immediately knew there must be something off with locale of the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a locale? It’s how Linux systems determines which language and character set a user sees when they log into a terminal session.  What is the default locale when pulling down a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 image?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@4ff94ee1780d:/# locale
LANG=
LANGUAGE=
LC_CTYPE=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_NUMERIC=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_TIME=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_COLLATE=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_MONETARY=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_MESSAGES=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_PAPER=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_NAME=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_ADDRESS=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_TELEPHONE=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_MEASUREMENT=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_IDENTIFICATION=&quot;POSIX&quot;
LC_ALL=
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What??!!  POSIX??!!! What’s the POSIX Locale?  The POSIX locale is another name for the C locale  (That’s ANSI C not the C Language)  which is another name for “if you expect to see any Unicode characters, haha, the jokes on you” locale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to fix this?  Basically you need to add the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;locale-gen&lt;/code&gt; program to your container, generate and set the locale to something more appropriate.  This can be accomplished by adding the following to your Dockerfile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FROM ubuntu:16.04

RUN apt-get clean &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt-get update
RUN apt-get install locales
RUN locale-gen en_US.UTF-8  
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8  
ENV LANGUAGE en_US:en  
ENV LC_ALL en_US.UTF-8 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After rebuilding my docker image and running it, I “ssh” (start an interactive bash session) into the container to check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@15dc539c6e1c:/# locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=en_US:en
LC_CTYPE=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_NUMERIC=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_TIME=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_COLLATE=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_MONETARY=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_MESSAGES=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_PAPER=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_NAME=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_ADDRESS=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_TELEPHONE=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_MEASUREMENT=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_IDENTIFICATION=&quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks good.  Finally, I check the previous Greek test files and see that the characters are properly rendered.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Today I Learned How to Setup a Rails Environment on Solus</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2017/05/12/today-i-learned-to-setup-rails-env-solus/"/>
   <updated>2017-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2017/05/12/today-i-learned-to-setup-rails-env-solus</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today I Learned&lt;/em&gt; how to set up a Rails development environment on Solus.  I’ve been running the &lt;a href=&quot;https://solus-project.com/&quot;&gt;Solus distribution&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of months now.  I wanted to move over some of my local development environments from my Fedora laptop.  This is a little bit of a challenge if you’re used to mainstream Linux distributions (mainstream Linux seems like a bit of a oxymoron) with familiar tools such as apt or yum.  Solus is pretty new and not forked from another distro.  It has its own packaging system called ‘eopkg’.  These are the steps I had to take to get a Rails environment up and running and deployed using Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I had to install all the packages needed to get Rails up and running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo eopkg install -c system.devel&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo eopkg install ruby-devel&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo eopkg install sqlite3-devel&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo eopkg install nodejs&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo gem install rails&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was using postgres, I also had to run the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo eopkg install postgresql&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo eokpkg install postgresql-devel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that’s left is to download and install the Heroku command line client:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wget https://cli-assets.heroku.com/branches/stable/heroku-linux-amd64.tar.gz -O heroku.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tar zxvf heroku.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd heroku&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Heroku client finished installing, I was able to clone my Rails projects and get them up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Today I Learned About Running Shell Commands in Ruby</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2017/04/26/today-i-learned-about-ruby-shell-commands/"/>
   <updated>2017-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2017/04/26/today-i-learned-about-ruby-shell-commands</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today I Learned&lt;/em&gt; about running shell commands in Ruby.  I’m really familiar with bash and it feels really natural for me to use backticks to run shell commands.  A coworker who was looking over my code got confused by them and asked why I didn’t use some other options.  At the very least, backticks can look pretty ugly in your Ruby code and since it confused a fellow coworker, I spent a little time looking at other ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backticks or %x()&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty much the same way you would use them in bash. Simply put backticks around your command and it runs the way one would expect, returning standard output (standard error gets printed to the screen) of the shell command.  You can access the exit value with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$?&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;irb --simple-prompt&lt;/code&gt; example:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/backtick_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;Backtick Example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Input your command as a string (i.e. quote it) to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;system&lt;/code&gt;, it returns true if
the exit status is zero, otherwise it returns false.  This is a good method if you don’t care about the standard output of the command you’re running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;irb --simple-prompt&lt;/code&gt; example:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/system_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;System Example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;exec&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is replace the current running process (i.e. will not run a new shell) and
runs the command.  I’m not sure when it would be best to use this.  Perhaps when you don’t want to fork too many processes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;irb --simple-prompt&lt;/code&gt; example:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/exec_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;Exec Example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Today I Learned About Netcat</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2017/04/08/today-i-learned-about-netcat/"/>
   <updated>2017-04-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2017/04/08/today-i-learned-about-netcat</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today I learned&lt;/em&gt; about netcat, a utility written in 1995 for writing and reading data to TCP and UDP connections.
It’s been called the “swiss army knife” of network utilities and from the little bit I’ve experiemented with,
I can see why!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;netcat&lt;/code&gt;, the actual command you run is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt;.  Here are a couple of examples of using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt;
that I found interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scanning for a Port&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say I’m running a webserver on localhost:4000 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;’s default).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then run the following in a terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nc -v -z -w 1 localhost 3995-4000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;netcat&lt;/code&gt; will scan through localhost’s port range 3995-4000, spitting out messages like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/nc-port-scan.png&quot; alt=&quot;Netcat Port Scan&quot; /&gt;
At the very end, we can see that port 4000 was connected to successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving up a Webpage for One Connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to send a message through a webpage that can only be view once?  Ok, yeah I know. Who would want to do that?
(Just work with me here!) &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;netcat&lt;/code&gt; can do that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;message.txt&lt;/code&gt; with the following content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This message will self destruct as soon as you hit the refresh button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Execute the following:  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;-ne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: $(wc -c &amp;lt;message.txt)\r\n\r\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;message.txt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;nc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;-l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if I open up a browser and point to ‘http://localhost:8080’, I will see my message.  If I refresh the page,
the page goes away.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;netcat&lt;/code&gt; serves the file and exits as soon as the first client hits it.  Pretty cool, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a Backdoor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;netcat&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/code&gt; flag,  you can create backdoors to your systems (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/code&gt; forks the process and redirects input/output).  It is possible to make any process a network server, listen on a port, and pipe the input to that process.  This is similar to SSH reverse tunneling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have 2 computers on the same network.  &lt;br /&gt;
On the 1st computer, run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nc -l -p 1777 -e /bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 2nd computer, run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nc &amp;lt;IP_ADDRESS_OF_1ST_COMPUTER&amp;gt; 1777&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, type any shell command like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;touch i_see_you.txt&lt;/code&gt; and see the commands get executed on the first computer.  Way cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know anything about &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;netcat&lt;/code&gt; before today, but the tiny bit I’ve discovered tells me it’s going to be a valuable tool to have in my toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My First 3 Open Source Contributions</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/11/30/my-first-3-open-source-contributions/"/>
   <updated>2016-11-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/11/30/my-first-3-open-source-contributions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Getting started in an open source project can be incredibly intimidating.  You may ask yourself questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Which project should I get involved with?  &lt;br /&gt;
 How do I get started? &lt;br /&gt;
 Are the moderators nice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You hear stories about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/11/linus_torvalds_in_sweary_rant_about_punctuation_in_kernel_comments/&quot;&gt;Linus Torvalds’ brutal comments&lt;/a&gt; and you don’t want to be on the other end of those types of emails.  Well, not every project is the 
Linux Kernel and there are some really great communities out there able and willing to help someone starting out.
I wanted to share my experiences with my first 3 open source contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;duckduckgo&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; is a Google alternative.  The company wants to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/about/&quot;&gt;provide a search engine&lt;/a&gt; that respects your privacy and doesn’t
track the user.  They have the notion of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.duckduckhack.com/welcome/how-ias-work.html&quot;&gt;Instant Answer&lt;/a&gt; which is essentially a result to a search query.  One form of an Instant Answer is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.duckduckhack.com/walkthroughs/programming-syntax.html&quot;&gt;cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;.  Contributing a cheat sheet to the search platform is a fairly simple way to make your first contribution.  They also have a great community on Slack, where I was personally emailed by their community manager after signing up.  The community manager introduced himself and warmly welcomed me into the group.  This personal touch was really indicative of the type of community being harbored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DuckDuckGo also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.duckduckhack.com/&quot;&gt;fantastic documentation on how to get started&lt;/a&gt;.  They use Codio, a cloud IDE which makes &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.duckduckhack.com/welcome/setup-dev-environment.html&quot;&gt;setting up a development environment&lt;/a&gt; extremely easy.  I was interested in a contributing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perforce.com/&quot;&gt;Perforce&lt;/a&gt; cheat sheet where a user can easily find a reference to the command line client.  In a couple of hours, I was able to read through the documentation, set up the environment and make my first contribution.  The community was very attentive and gave friendly feedback.  After a couple of days, my Perforce cheat sheet was on their staging site.  About a week later, it was on the production site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a user can now enter a search like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ddg-search.png&quot; alt=&quot;DuckDuckGo Search&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And get results like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;perforce-patcher&quot;&gt;Perforce Patcher&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all open source projects are large official projects.  There are many personal projects out there with a sole author willing to accept help and contributions.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlspace.info/2016/03/patch-utility-for-perforce/&quot;&gt;Perforce Patcher&lt;/a&gt;, written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/prbuddha&quot;&gt;Buddha Jyothiprasad&lt;/a&gt;, is JavaFX application that creates patches based on diffs from changelists.  I never had any experience with JavaFX applications but I knew enough Java to read through the code and make basic sense of it.  I wanted to add the ability to start the application with some command line arguments to pre-populate the initial login fields. I made the the change and submitted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jbuddha/perforce-patcher/pull/2&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;.  The author was really nice and asked me to update the README with my changes and merged in my commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gitlab&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to learn more about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; framework and know that the best way to learn a new tech stack is to delve into a project using ia project’s .
GitLab has really thorough &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;guide on contributing&lt;/a&gt; and a fairly formalized process.  Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit&quot;&gt;instructions for setting up a development environment&lt;/a&gt; is detailed enough to get started but not overwhelming.  They use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name[]=up-for-grabs&quot;&gt;up-for-grabs&lt;/a&gt; label on their issues which can be picked up and fixed by anyone who has the desire to contribute.  My only issue(no pun intended) is that once someone has claimed it, there doesn’t seem to be a way to know from the list without drilling down to each individual ticket.  I decided to get my feet wet by fixing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/24554&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; that required a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/lizlam/gitlab-ce/commit/5c747ded7ecc1d7da418a854d12ad2906b173b7b&quot;&gt;simple text change&lt;/a&gt;.  Picking out low hanging fruit is good way to get acquainted with a project’s workflow and development environment.  I submitted my &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/7553&quot;&gt;merge request&lt;/a&gt; and the moderators were really responsive and enthusiastic.  After a little back and forth, I made my first GitLab contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributing to open source projects is not as scary as it may seem.  There are a lot of friendly and well run projects that are welcoming to the new contributor.  Helping out smaller projects with a sole author is also a great way to collaborate, learn and not reinvent the wheel.  I hope this encourages you to find a project you’re interested in and to be unafraid to make that first commit.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First Impressions of Scuttle! by Jellybean Games</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/10/21/game-review-scuttle/"/>
   <updated>2016-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/10/21/game-review-scuttle</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just received my copy of &lt;em&gt;Scuttle!&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jellybean-games.com/&quot;&gt;Jellybean Games&lt;/a&gt; in the mail. I backed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peterchayward/scuttle-the-pirate-card-game-for-all-ages&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; last April and to be honest, I’m pretty amazed I already have a copy of it in my hands (Kickstarters are notorious for being late to deliver).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jellybean Games appealed to me because they make family-friendly games.  This has become more important to me since I am a relatively new mom with a young family.  I grew up playing board games and it’s something I definitely want to pass on to my own kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before even opening the package, the first thing I have to comment on is the sturdiness of the box.  It is probably one of the best card boxes I’ve seen.  I know that seems like a superficial thing, but a high quality box will help preserve the cards and anyone with kids know - that’s important.  The cards are beautiful.  The graphics are colorful and fun.  My only complaint is I wish the cards were slightly larger (they are approximately 3.5” x 2.25”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/scuttle-cards.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scuttle! Cards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included are rules for 1-5 players (yes, there is a solo variant for 1 player).  My first impression is based on the 2 player variant.  Essentially, you’re trying to win by scoring 21 (much like my favorite casino game).  This is a pirate-themed card game, so you are collecting treasures in the form of doubloons.  The first person to collect 21 doubloon wins.  Of course there are fun ways to prevent others from reaching that goal and also ways to help accelerate your own treasure chest ledger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’m quite pleased with how the Kickstarter was ran (fairly frequent and enthusiastic updates), the quality of the deck and the gameplay.  The game itself is simple enough for kids to learn easily yet there are enough variations to keep the parents interested.  &lt;em&gt;Scuttle!&lt;/em&gt; is going to be a family favorite.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Game Review: Tafl and Nine Men Morris by Creative Images</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/09/12/game-review-tafl-creative-images/"/>
   <updated>2016-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/09/12/game-review-tafl-creative-images</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s not easy to find a good quality hnefatafl set at a reasonable price.  &lt;em&gt;Tafl and Nine Men Morris&lt;/em&gt; by Creative Images (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/SevenOaksGrove&quot;&gt;SevenOaksGrove on Etsy&lt;/a&gt;) is certainly that and exceeds expectations by essentially including 3 games in 1. Not only is there a Nine Men’s Morris board on the other side but the artist also includes game instructions and pieces for Beserk Hnefatafl.  The extra glass pieces are designated with decorative crowns.  This is the first set I have come across with this variation and is definitely a unique feature to include.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/beserk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Crowned pieces&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not the biggest fan of canvas boards.  For example, the one that comes with the commercially produced &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.history-craft.co.uk/resin-casting-products/game-pieces-boards/hnefatafl-viking-game-pieces.aspx&quot;&gt;Viking Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a bit too flimsy for my taste (though the Lewis Chessmen inspired pieces that come with it are beautiful). But the canvas used for this set is thick, durable, beautifully designed and printed.  The graphics are bold and the customer service is awesome.
In addition to the Beserk rules, this set also includes printed instructions on how to play with Fetlar and
Copenhagen rules.  These are the two common rule sets used in tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with many products sold on Etsy, this is a hand-made item in which no two are going to be exactly alike.  Despite that, the set is very professionally made.  The company is ran by
a guy in Walla Walla, Washington who obviously takes a lot of pride in his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this was a great find.  I picked it up for my 7 year old nephew who instantly loved it when I gave it to 
him.  It’s portable, beautiful and a reasonably priced($25) hnefatafl set that anyone can enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Review of The Leprechaun Companion</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/09/06/leprechaun-companion-review/"/>
   <updated>2016-09-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/09/06/leprechaun-companion-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Leprechaun Companion is a wonderfully illustrated and imaginative book.
It was written by Nigel Suckling, though you would be hard-pressed to actually find a copy with that name on it. He
wrote this particular book under the pen name, Niall Macnamara, the name given to him by the leprechauns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally purchased this book in order to read a bit more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://tafl.cyningstan.com/download/968/magpie-leaflet&quot;&gt;Magpie&lt;/a&gt;, a modern variation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://tafl.cyningstan.com/page/171/brandub&quot;&gt;brandub&lt;/a&gt;.
Brandub is an Irish variant of hneftafl played on a 7x7 board.  The author takes brandub and reimagines it with a leprechaun theme.  The king is replaced with a leprechaun who is only allowed to move one space at a time due to the weight of his pot of gold.  The defenders are the leprechaun’s friends assisting him to escape to a corner and the attackers are thieves trying to steal the gold.  Gameplay is essentially the same as brandub with this exception (one space moves for the king piece) and the leprechaun needs to be surrounded on 4 sides in order to be captured (or 3 sides if standing next to the central square, corner squares or edge).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  Not only did it contain this cute backstory about Magpie (the leprechaun’s favorite game), it also included a comprehensive set of rules with diagrams and two beautiful usable boards in the inside covers (you will need to provide your own pieces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/lp-magpie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Magpie&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapters are filled with delightful illustrations and
stories about these magical little creatures.  The author brings you into a world where fairies are real and you better pay attention to the leprechaun living in your house.  Though not exactly a children’s book, the mix of fantasy, history and Irish folklore will certainly entertain the child in you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/lp-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Review of The Lewis Chessmen Unmasked</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/08/14/lewis-chessman-unmasked-review/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/08/14/lewis-chessman-unmasked-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/07/27/hnefatafl-book-reviews/&quot;&gt;recent fascination&lt;/a&gt; with the ancient game of hnefatafl has led me to the discovery of the Lewis Chessmen.  This is in part because of unfortunately accurate Amazon recommendations and also because the most commercially available set, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tafl.cyningstan.com/stock/1242/the-viking-game&quot;&gt;The Viking Game&lt;/a&gt; uses pieces inspired by them. There are a ton of books out there about the Lewis Chessmen. The British Museum and the National Museum of Scotland put on a joint exhibition (not all the pieces belong to one museum) in 2010. &lt;em&gt;The Lewis Chessmen: Unmasked&lt;/em&gt; by David Caldwell is the companion book to that exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/statements/the_lewis_chessmen.aspx&quot;&gt;The Lewis Chessmen&lt;/a&gt; is a collection of chess pieces dating back to the 12th century.  They were found accidentally in the
Isle of Lewis.  The book does a wonderful job of describing its mysterious discovery, its Scandanavian roots and theories about who they may have belonged to.  It’s a short (80 pages) companion book and catalogs each piece 
with beautiful photographs. Two of the pages are dedicated to connecting the chessmen to hnefatafl, suggesting that the kings doubled as pieces in both games.  There is evidence to support this notion as double-sided boards have been found at archaelogical sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is a great read and introduces these little figures in a compelling way.
Though it is a pale substitute for viewing the chessmen in real life, it does a pretty good job of fueling the intrigue. &lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Three Cork Brandub</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/08/05/brandub-in-3-corks/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/08/05/brandub-in-3-corks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a previous post, I’ve described how I made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/07/31/diy-hnefatafl-5-bottles-of-wine/&quot;&gt;tablut game with 5 bottles of wine&lt;/a&gt; (well not really the
 bottles of wine but the corks). 
I thought it would be fun to try making another hnefatafl set but wanted to try something different.&lt;br /&gt;
The corks I used before just happened to have designs on the ends making them perfect for designating 
two types of pieces without extra effort.   But not all corks are decorated as such, so I started thinking 
about ways I could color them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rummaging around the house, I found an ink set for stamping and calligraphy.  I took a look in my kitchen drawer and
found 3 wine corks lacking decorative ends from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.louismartini.com/&quot;&gt;Louis M. Martini&lt;/a&gt; (Which by the way is a great winery to visit if you’re ever in the Napa Valley area). 3 corks is perfect for making game components for an Irish variant of hnefatafl called &lt;a href=&quot;http://tafl.cyningstan.com/page/171/brandub&quot;&gt;brandub&lt;/a&gt;.  It is the smallest of all the hnefatafl games, requiring just 13 pieces: 4 defenders, 8 attackers and 1 king.  After cutting the corks, I inked the cross section and found the  corks absorbed the color quite well.  I put them aside and let them dry for 20 minutes but noticed when I picked them up the ink still rubbed off onto my finger.  So I grabbed a bottle of Elmer’s glue, put a thin white layer on the inked side and let it dry again.  Elmer’s  glue, for the most part dries pretty clear and it seemed to do the job of sealing the color relatively well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brandub is played on a 7x7 squared board.  In 1932, one was unearthed in Ballinderry, Ireland dating back to the 
10th century.  There is some debate on whether or not this board was used to play brandub or some other games.  But
there seems to be enough evidence in it’s design to support brandub play.  Having an affinity for history and its artifacts,  I
grabbed an image online of the Ballinderry board, printed it out and used it for my makeshift brandub set. Obviously playing with cork pieces on printed paper isn’t as nice as playing on a high quality set.  But with all the different
hnefatafl variations out there, it’s nice to experiment and see which version you like before buying one.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Do-It-Yourself Hnefatafl with 5 Bottles of Wine</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/07/31/diy-hnefatafl-5-bottles-of-wine/"/>
   <updated>2016-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/07/31/diy-hnefatafl-5-bottles-of-wine</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently become intrigued with the ancient Viking game, hnefatafl.  Since my discovery of this game, I’ve downloaded versions of it on my
phone, read a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/07/27/hnefatafl-book-reviews/&quot;&gt;couple of books&lt;/a&gt; on the subject and perused many sets and sites online. Though there are some commercial sets for sale, hnefatafl isn’t exactly mainstream.  You’re not
going to find it at your local Walmart.  As a result, there are a lot of do-it-yourself sets out there.  Some of the ones I’ve seen are examples of some seriously skilled workmanship.  Others are crude but functional.  All are fun and creative.  There are only 3 types of pieces needed for hnefatafl, the king, the defenders and the attackers.  This simple setup makes it possible to construct a set out of everyday found objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love wine and often times save the corks. I have a kitchen drawer full of them.  The thought occured to me that it might be a fun evening project to make a hnefatal set out of the corks in order to play a few games.  I was already waiting for a hand-made set to come in the mail, but I figured, why wait?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So began my crafty evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed a wine cork and a bread knife and started experimenting with different size cuts.  It was possible
to make 6 components per cork if you cut them horizontally at 2 cm a piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2cm-6-pieces-cut-cork.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of 6 cut wine cork pieces&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided I wanted to make a variant called &lt;a href=&quot;http://tafl.cyningstan.com/page/170/tablut&quot;&gt;tablut&lt;/a&gt; which requires 25 pieces:
8 defenders, 16 attackers and 1 king.  As it turns out, 5 bottles of wine was all I needed to accomplish this.  I happened to have
corks from Spiral Cellars (probably the best &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefermentedfruit.com/spiral-cellars-cabernet-review-trader-joes-wine/&quot;&gt;Napa Valley Cabernet for under $10&lt;/a&gt;).  The spiral design at the end of the corks were perfect for distinguishing defender pieces from attacker pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/spiral-defenders.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cork pieces with Spiral design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the attacker and defender pieces were done, I designated the king’s piece by making it a little taller.  After 5 minutes of cutting, I had all the pieces needed for a tablut set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all I needed was a board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swedish botanist Carl Linneaus is credited for having the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/stream/ungdomsskrifter02linne#page/n155/mode/2up&quot;&gt;most complete description of tablut&lt;/a&gt; and its rules.  These
rules were recorded in 1732 with a drawing of a tablut board and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/stream/ungdomsskrifter02linne#page/n157/mode/2up&quot;&gt;playing pieces&lt;/a&gt;. I figured Carl Linneaus’ diagram was just as good as
any board.  It’s actually not his original drawing but an English translation of it published in 1811.  That was close enough for my purposes.  I went online, grabbed a graphic of it, printed it out and was on my way to playing a few rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: The cross section of a wine cork is about an inch, so I needed to scale accordingly when printing the board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/tablut-cork-game-in-progress.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tablut game in progress&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linneaus’ diagram, though historical and interesting, felt a little bland.  I thought I’d have some fun and splash a little color on it while trying to preserve the original design.  I checked the graphic into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perforce.com&quot;&gt;Perforce&lt;/a&gt; server and experimented with colors/filters producing a slew of &lt;a href=&quot;https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/files/guest/liz_lam/tablut-fun/main#commits&quot;&gt;revisions&lt;/a&gt;.  Experimentations can be viewed with this Timelapse View &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/176825722&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I printed out the version I liked the most and voila!  Craft night is a success! I now have my own tablut/hnefatafl set to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Review On The Hnefatafl (Viking Chess) Books</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/07/27/hnefatafl-book-reviews/"/>
   <updated>2016-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2016/07/27/hnefatafl-book-reviews</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I grew up playing board games.  My uncle taught me at a very early age how to play classic
Western games such as chess and checkers.  He also taught me how to play games relating to our Chinese
culture and heritage such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_(board_game)&quot;&gt;dou shou qui&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi&quot;&gt;xiang qi&lt;/a&gt;.  So it was only natural when I stumbled upon
the ancient Viking game of hfneftafl that I would instantly be fascinated by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hnefatafl is a predecessor of chess.  It is simpler to play but just as addicting.  The first thing that is very apparent is that there are not a lot of sources about the history and roots of hnefatafl
in general.  Where there are tons of books about games such as chess and backgammon, book resources
on this Viking game is almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN&quot;&gt;NaN&lt;/a&gt;.  Which is why I was pleased to discover these two books
by Damian Walker, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tafl.cyningstan.com/weblinks/1346/an-introduction-to-hnefatafl&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Hnefatafl&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://tafl.cyningstan.com/weblinks/1068/reconstructing-hnefatafl&quot;&gt;Reconstructing Hnefatafl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Introduction to Hnefatafl&lt;/em&gt; is exactly what it sounds like.  This little book is a great introduction
to the history of the ancient board game.  It also describes the rules of play.  It’s a quick read packed with a lot of interesting facts. 
It surveys quite a bit, covering topics from its mysterious origins to its modern revival.  In some ways, the book really paints a broad picture about the migration of
the Vikings and the game they left behind.  In just 43 pages, the book fueled my interest and made me want
to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reconstructing Hnefatafl&lt;/em&gt; takes on a more academic approach (though just as readable).  It goes through different
historical texts and reconstructs the rules of different variations of the game.  For example, the author takes a
diary written in 1732 with a fairly complete description of the game of tablut (a variation of hnefatafl) and reconstructs the rules accordingly.  Some historical texts are less comprehensive, in which Walker walks (no pun intended) us through the steps of how he fills in the gaps.  He also takes archaelogical
evidence, such as excavated game boards and meticulously deduces game play from them.  This is another short read and in 64 pages I was able to learn more about this fascinating game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, both these books are a great way to learn about hnefatafl.  The game itself is pretty fun
and these books will definitely enhance your appreciation (and your geek factor) for this little known gem.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Astrophotography For Under $80</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2015/10/20/astrophotography-for-under-eighty/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2015/10/20/astrophotography-for-under-eighty</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve always loved looking up at the stars.  As a child, it was one of my many simple pleasures.
The night sky has often been my companion in times of reflection and solitude.  Being able to
capture glimpses of these moments is a hobby I always wanted to explore.  So it was with great
enthusiasm that I researched how to get into astrophotography.  As far as I could tell, I just needed
a few things: a telescope, a camera and a way to attach the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purchasing a telescope for the first time can be a really intimidating thing.  I wasn’t ready
to spend thousands of dollars on one, but I didn’t want to buy a toy either.  Then I saw a reference
to the Galileoscope in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/828758431/messier-observers-planisphere&quot;&gt;Kickstarter project&lt;/a&gt; I was perusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.galileoscope.org&quot;&gt;Galileoscope&lt;/a&gt; is a telescope kit you can put together.  It’s basically an educational device
to learn about optics and you end up with a no frills telescope similar to the one Galileo used.  Many retailers sell the kit for
about $50, but after some quick research, I figured out that I could buy them directly from www.galileoscope.org for $25 each.
The catch was you needed to purchase a box of 6.  Well, I didn’t need 6 telescopes, so I sent an email out
to a group of friends in attempt to get 5 other people in on a bulk purchase.  It didn’t take long to get 5 takers and within
a week I had a box of 6 Galileoscopes in my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telescope  ✔&lt;br /&gt;
Cost: $25 + $5 Shipping &amp;amp; Handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Galileoscope needs a standard camera tripod to be mounted on.  I didn’t have one lying around but was able to
purchase one on Amazon for a relatively cheap price.  I have Amazon Prime, so shipping was free (sort of).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tripod  ✔&lt;br /&gt;
Cost: $25&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to purchase a camera is just as intimidating as trying to purchase a telescope.  Should I get a point and shoot? Should I get an SLR?&lt;br /&gt;
Then it dawned on me that if I can use my phone camera, I wouldn’t have to worry about the choice.  Now don’t scoff, I have a Motorola Droid
Mini with a 12 megapixel camera, and although it can’t compete with an SLR - it definitely can hold its on.  So what I really needed was an
adapter to attach my phone to the telescope.  Again with some help from Amazon, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013D2ULO6?keywords=telescope%20phone%20adpater&amp;amp;qid=1445416268&amp;amp;ref_=sr_1_sc_1&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spell&quot;&gt;I found an adapter&lt;/a&gt; that I thought would do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phone adapter for telescope  ✔&lt;br /&gt;
Cost:  $25&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together is a little tricky.  You need to make sure the focuser tube is tight on the Galileoscope because the weight of the adapter and phone can cause it to slide.  The phone camera needs to be aligned up with the eyepiece and focusing the telescope with it attached requires a bit
of patience.  But overall I was quite pleased with the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a photo of the moon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/moon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;moon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a great introductory setup and for less than $80, a worthy route into the world of astrophotography.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Continuous Delivery Fun with Jenkins and a Raspberry Pi</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2015/09/10/cd-fun-jenkins-rpi/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2015/09/10/cd-fun-jenkins-rpi</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins-ci.org/&quot;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; is a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration&quot;&gt;CI&lt;/a&gt; tool for driving build and test automation. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; is a credit card-sized device used for learning about software and hardware, and is incredibly popular as a platform for a variety of DIY projects. Being a fan of both, the proverbial lightbulb turned on (no pun intended) as I thought of a project that would combine the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenkins has a great dashboard that monitors the status of jobs; I thought it would be fun to introduce a physical computing element by using the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins and LED lights to monitor the results of Jenkins jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My setup is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi 2 Model B&lt;/a&gt; running the Raspbian OS. The first thing I needed to do was figure out how to connect the LED lights that represent the different Jenkins states to the GPIO pins. I’m fairly new to the physical computing space and there are a lot of tutorials out there on how to connect LED lights to a RPi; I went with the non-breadboard, non-soldering route. Using only jumper wires and resistors, I connected up the LEDs then housed all of it in a plastic container that was originally packaging for a baby pacifier (yes, you read that right!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, you’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 yellow LED light to represent UNSTABLE status&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 blue LED light to represent SUCCESS status&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 red LED light to represent FAILURE status&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9 female-to-female jumper wires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 270-Ohm resistors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have all the materials, connecting an LED light to a Raspberry Pi is pretty straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With a jumper wire, connect one leg of the LED to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/&quot;&gt;GPIO&lt;/a&gt; pin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the other leg to a ground pin using a resistor  &lt;br /&gt;
 (LED leg -&amp;gt; jumper wire -&amp;gt; resistor -&amp;gt; jumper wire -&amp;gt; ground pin)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat this for each LED and keep a note of the GPIO pin numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of DIY projects is that you can be as creative or conventional as you’d like. Feel free to use a green LED light to designate a success state (or any color, for that matter) – I decided to stay consistent with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins.io/blog/2012/03/13/why-does-jenkins-have-blue-balls/&quot;&gt;default blue ball status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software bridge will consist of the GPIO module for the Raspberrry Pi and the Jenkins Python API. Using both of these libraries I was able to write a script that checks the latest Jenkins job status and lights up the appropriate LED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/files/guest/liz_lam/jenkins-rpi-led-status&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; for this project is located in the Perforce Workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to branch it and modify it for your own Continuous Delivery fun!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Girl Geek Thoughts - Mentorship</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2014/10/10/girl-geek-thoughts-mentorship/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2014/10/10/girl-geek-thoughts-mentorship</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My first tech mentor was named Simon. He sat me down in front a computer running MS-DOS when I was 9 years old. He encouraged me to explore the system using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; commands. He instructed me to look for files ending in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;com&lt;/code&gt; in order to run them. He taught me how to copy, move and rename files. He showed me his CAD drawings and how they related to his work with machinery. He was the best mentor a little girl could have. He was patient, understanding, enthusiastic, and he is also my father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard a lot about the Women in Tech movements over the years. I really love that there are more events and resources for women today, both young and mature, to advance their careers and raise awareness. Perforce has also participated in some of these events. In December of 2011, we hosted &lt;a href=&quot;http://bayareagirlgeekdinners.com/bay-area-girl-geek-dinner-14-sponsored-by-perforce/&quot;&gt;Bay Area Girl Geek Dinner #14&lt;/a&gt;.  It was an &lt;a href=&quot;http://bayareagirlgeekdinners.com/notes-from-perforce-girl-geek-dinner/&quot;&gt;awesome event&lt;/a&gt;, so I can’t tell you how pleased I was to hear we were going to have another one. I also thought it was impeccable timing that we sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;http://bayareagirlgeekdinners.com/perforce-girl-geek-dinner-2014/&quot;&gt;Girl Geek Dinner #64&lt;/a&gt; shortly after Google released &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; regarding the diversity in their workforce. It was interesting to read that women make up about 18% of all computer science graduates in the U.S. I was a CS major towards the end of the first dot com bubble, so for me the numbers were closer to 28%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am almost certain I would not have pursued a technical degree if it wasn’t for my father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentorship is key. It’s important to encourage and be available to others. This can sometimes be difficult, especially when dealing with aggressive deadlines and maneuvering around in the sometimes crazy world called “the Software Industry.” At Perforce, I’ve been able to work with students from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.girlsinc.org/&quot;&gt;Girls Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and graduates from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackbrightacademy.com/&quot;&gt;Hackbright Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Mentorship comes in many forms and it doesn’t necessarily need to be formalized. A little bit can go a long way. As a woman in a tech role, I am proud to be a part of a company that also gives me the opportunity to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and thanks Dad.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Run Perforce and Your Website on a Raspberry Pi</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2014/02/18/run-p4d-and-website-on-rpi/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2014/02/18/run-p4d-and-website-on-rpi</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Are you looking for a cheap way to run your personal Perforce server? Need a quick and dirty way to serve your website from it? This could be your next easy Raspberry Pi 2 project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) On your Raspberry Pi, run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wget ftp://ftp.perforce.com/perforce/r15.2/bin.linux26armhf/p4d&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wget ftp://ftp.perforce.com/perforce/r15.2/bin.linux26armhf/p4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Change permissions so that the files are executable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chmod +x p4&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chmod +x p4d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) Move the files to the bin directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo mv p4* /usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.) Start p4d:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mkdir /home/pi/p4root&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p4d -r /home/pi/p4root -p raspberrypi:1666 -d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.) Create a Perforce workspace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mkdir /home/pi/p4client&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd /home/pi/p4clienti p4 -p raspberrypi:1666 client&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: vim will start, perform a :wq [enter]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.) Create a test index.html file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Hello World! &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot; &amp;gt; index.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.) Submit it to your Perforce server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p4 -p raspberrypi:1666 add index.html&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p4 -p raspberrypi:1666 submit -d &quot;Adding index.html to my raspberry pi p4 server&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.) Start the builtin python HTTP server that comes with the Raspian image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python -m SimpleHTTPServer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9.) Open a browser and point to http://127.0.0.1:8000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have a Perforce server and your versioned website running on your Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a slightly updated article that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perforce.com/blog/140228/run-p4d-website-raspberry-pi&quot;&gt;originally published&lt;/a&gt; on the Perforce Corporate Blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Directories are Folders</title>
   <link href="http://blog.lizlam.com/2012/08/21/directories-are-folders/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://blog.lizlam.com/2012/08/21/directories-are-folders</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently had the opportunity to spend some time with our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.girlsinc.org/&quot;&gt;Girls Inc.&lt;/a&gt; marketing intern. She is a junior from one of our local high schools and had an interest in getting some hands-on Perforce exposure. I only had an hour so I kept my goals simple. I wanted to teach her how to create her very first “Hello World” shell script, check it into the depot, make edits, and view revision history with some of our tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I asked her to do was to open a terminal window and navigate to a certain directory using the cd command. With a puzzled look, she asked,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s a directory?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A directory is where your files reside.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She still looked puzzled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s basically a folder. Do you know what a folder is?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh yes, I know what a folder is!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how surreal this moment was for me. I was her age when Windows 95 came out. I recall creating folders in the GUI and opening DOS prompts to check that a directory had actually been created. I knew what directories were, but folders I was suspicious of. This went on for some time before I finally trusted that creating folders did indeed make directories. I take this knowledge for granted and then realized that many &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface&quot;&gt;CLI&lt;/a&gt; commands won’t make sense unless you know what a directory is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step was to show her how to use VI to create and edit her first HelloWorld.sh. I was surprised and proud that she was able to maneuver around in VI fairly easily. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-client&quot;&gt;P4V&lt;/a&gt;, she marked the shell script for add and submitted the file to one of our test depots. I showed her how to view revision history using &lt;a href=&quot;Revision Graph&quot;&gt;Revision Graph&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perforce.com/support/tutorial-video-library/video/using-time-lapse-view&quot;&gt;Time-lapse View&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools&quot;&gt;P4Merge&lt;/a&gt;. She was particularly interested in seeing diffs with P4Merge referring to it as “cool.” Which I consider a big win coming from a teenager! Finally, I showed her how to execute the same steps using our p4 command line client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hour was up and I was happy to cover what we did. I’m constantly amazed by the learning experiences I have by working at Perforce. I initially set out to teach our intern about Perforce. She ended up giving me insights about the software and technology experience for a teenager in 2012. And trust me, they’re not checking what happens after a folder gets created.&lt;/p&gt;
